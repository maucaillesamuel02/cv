  <p><em><strong>Software</strong> Engineering in process</em></p>
  <br>
  <p>I was born in March 2nd <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997" title="The year 1997">1997</a> in Lima, Peru. Raised by a middle class family in the suburns
    of Chorrillos a Lima's district. I used to enjoy playing videogames and my curiosity about how
    they work started to grow. Some information was confusing and not very pleasent to begin with
    in this world of programming. Hence I opted to study <strong>Software Engineering</strong> in 2013, but had troubles
    when trying to apply for a place in a public university. However, I found pretty fascinating how
    science and pure mathematics work, thanks for the environment in which I learned. Higlhy competitive,
    tons of inspiration raised among my fellows friends and I couldn't be involved in this movement.
